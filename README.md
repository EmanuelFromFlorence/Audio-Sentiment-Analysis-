This project is a deep learning model that can be used to classify audio data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The model is trained on a dataset of audio recordings that have been manually labeled with their sentiment. The model can be used to analyze audio data from a variety of sources, such as customer reviews, phone calls, and social media posts.

The model is implemented in Python using the Keras deep learning library. The model is trained on a dataset of audio recordings that have been manually labeled with their sentiment. The model can be used to analyze audio data from a variety of sources, such as customer reviews, phone calls, and social media posts.

The model is still under development, but it has been shown to be effective in classifying audio data with a high degree of accuracy. The model can be used to improve the customer experience by providing businesses with insights into how their customers feel about their products and services. The model can also be used to improve the security of systems by detecting malicious activity, such as fraud and spam.

**Features:**

* Classifies audio data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
* Can be used to analyze audio data from a variety of sources.
* Still under development, but has been shown to be effective in classifying audio data with a high degree of accuracy.

**Usage:**

* To use the model, you will need to provide it with an audio file.
* The model will then classify the audio file into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
* You can use the model to improve the customer experience, improve the security of systems, or for other purposes.
